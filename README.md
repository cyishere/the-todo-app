# About

**TBC**

I'm learning React.js for months since March 2020. I learned from many tutorials, read documents, made little apps. But recently I realized that I seemed couldn't build a todo app properly. So I started this project to go through from scratch to solid my acknowledgment.

## Main Branch

A simple todo app made with React.js & Fake API.

## Branch: with-redux

Refactoring the app with Redux.
